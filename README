Chimp OS
A primitive 32 bit operating system.
This is a recreational programming project.

Developing a 32 bit operating system for the x86 i686 architecture.

Requirements
- i686-elf cross compiler (GCC)
- Linker and Assembler (Binutils)
- QEMU
- GRUB bootloader

Usage
$ ./clean.sh
$ ./headers.sh
$ ./iso.sh
$ ./qemu.sh


Kernel Design
- Paging (Virtual Memory Space) 
- Multithreaded Kernel
Command Shell 
- Sits on top of kernel
- Provide simple I/O and uses kernel for low level tasks

Design Notes
libc and libk
libc: hosted library, required. 
libk: freestanding library that does not contain any code specific to user space
